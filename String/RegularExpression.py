"""
This line is cleaning and preparing the string s for the palindrome check. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

1. re.sub(r'\W+', '', s)

What it does:
It removes all non-word characters (\W+) from the string s.

Why it's used:
A palindrome check should ignore punctuation and special characters. For example:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output after this step: "AmanaplanacanalPanama"

Key Concept (\W+):
\W: Matches any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore (e.g., !, @, #, spaces, etc.).
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.

Why use re.sub here?
re.sub is specifically designed to perform regex-based replacements.
The regular string method replace() cannot match patterns like \W+; it only replaces exact substrings.
